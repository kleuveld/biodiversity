Nature is under severe pressure worldwide, with a projected continuous loss by 2050. Despite our society's reliance on nature's services, the global economic impact is largely unknown.

A pioneering project is now integrating the expertise of economists and ecologists to uncover which countries and sectors will be most affected by this loss. üåøüìâ

# Understanding the Economic Risks
While the financial sector has improved its understanding of climate-related risks, insights into the economic impacts of nature loss are still lacking. According to the World Economic Forum, half of global GDP ‚Äì around EUR 44 trillion ‚Äì is tied to nature.
With new EU regulations requiring large companies to disclose information on environmental risks and opportunities, understanding these impacts is more crucial than ever.

# Time for New Collaborations
The project 'Biodiversity Related Risks and Opportunities to the Financial Sector' combines economic and ecological models to assess the impact of ecosystem services across 51 countries and regions. The MAGNET model from Wageningen Economic Research will simulate these impacts, with ecologists from @WageningenUniversity and the @FoundationforSustainableDevelopment providing key insights.

Dr. Haki Pamuk of WUR states, "The financial sector needs to quantify biodiversity-related risks and opportunities, similar to efforts for climate change. This requires developing a model and data platform with quantified estimates for risks related to ecosystem services loss, and the costs and benefits of abatement measures."
Involvement from Financial Industry Leaders

This public-private partnership, funded by the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality, includes industry leaders like Deloitte, Allianz Group, APG, Ortec Finance, ING, and Commerzbank. Dr. Nicole R√∂ttmer from Deloitte emphasizes, "Science-based biodiversity data and scenarios need to be integrated into financial institutions‚Äô processes to meet regulatory and public demands."

This increased transparency and integration of impact on ecosystem services in financial processes is a critical step towards understanding and mitigating nature-related risks.
